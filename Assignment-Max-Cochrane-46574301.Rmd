## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


A) Load the data from the file sales.csv and create a scatter plot of Sales against Index.
Comment on the relationship between the two variables
```{r sales}
sales <- read.csv("sales.csv")
```
```{r sales}
plot(sales$Index, sales$Sales, 
     xlab = "Index", ylab = "Sales", 
     main = "Scatter Plot of Sales against Index")
```
**Comments**

B) Fit a simple linear regression model and named it as M1 to predict Sales using Index.
Validate the model through diagnostic checks and comment.

```{r sales}
M1 <- lm(Sales ~ Index, data = sales)
summary(M1)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(M1)
```
**Comments**

C) Fit two polynomial models of order 2 and order 3 to predict Sales using Index. Name the
quadratic model as M2 and the cubic model as M3. There is no need to validate the polynomial models
at this stage. Compare and comment.
```{r sales}
M2 <- lm(Sales ~ Index + I(Index^2), data = sales)
summary(M2)
M3 <- lm(Sales ~ Index + I(Index^2) + I(Index^3), data = sales)
summary(M3)
```
**Comments**

D) Plot the data and add the three predicted lines from models M1, M2, and M3 to your plot.
Comment on the fit of the models.

```{r sales}
plot(sales$Index, sales$Sales, 
     xlab = "Index", ylab = "Sales", 
     main = "Sales vs Index with Fitted Models")

abline(M1, col = "red", lwd = 2)

abline(sales$Index, predict(M2), col = "blue", lwd = 2)

abline(sales$Index, predict(M3), col = "green", lwd = 2)

legend("topright", legend = c("Linear Model (M1)", "Quadratic Model (M2)", "Cubic Model (M3)"), 
       col = c("red", "blue", "green"), lty = 1, lwd = 2)
```

**Comments**

E) Assess the significance of the linear, quadratic and cubic terms in M3 using a Sequential
Sum of Squares (Hint: A sequential ANOVA is necessary.) Comment on the results.

```{r sales}
M1 <- lm(Sales ~ Index, data = sales)
M2 <- lm(Sales ~ poly(Index, 2), data = sales)
M3 <- lm(Sales ~ poly(Index, 3), data = sales)

anova_M1_M2 <- anova(M1, M2)  
anova_M2_M3 <- anova(M2, M3)  

print(anova_M1_M2)
print(anova_M2_M3)
```


**Comments**

F) Choose the best model among M1, M2, and M3 and validate it. Provide reasoning and
comment on the model fit.

```{r sales}


```
