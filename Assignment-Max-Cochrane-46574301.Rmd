## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


A) Load the data from the file sales.csv and create a scatter plot of Sales against Index.
Comment on the relationship between the two variables
```{r sales}
sales <- read.csv("sales.csv")
```
```{r sales}
plot(sales$Index, sales$Sales, 
     xlab = "Index", ylab = "Sales", 
     main = "Scatter Plot of Sales against Index")
```
**Comments**

There is a positive correlation between sales and index, this means that as index increases, sales tend to increase.this graph shows there is a relation is present between the 2 variables

B) Fit a simple linear regression model and named it as M1 to predict Sales using Index.
Validate the model through diagnostic checks and comment.

```{r sales}
M1 <- lm(Sales ~ Index, data = sales)
summary(M1)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(M1)
```
**Comments**




C) Fit two polynomial models of order 2 and order 3 to predict Sales using Index. Name the
quadratic model as M2 and the cubic model as M3. There is no need to validate the polynomial models
at this stage. Compare and comment.
```{r sales}
M2 <- lm(Sales ~ Index + I(Index^2), data = sales)
summary(M2)
M3 <- lm(Sales ~ Index + I(Index^2) + I(Index^3), data = sales)
summary(M3)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(M2)
plot(M3)
```
**Comments**
You can see from the graphs that M2 is a slightly more effective model, the graphs show a slightly better trend in the Q-Q plot with M2 then in m3

D) Plot the data and add the three predicted lines from models M1, M2, and M3 to your plot.
Comment on the fit of the models.

```{r sales}
plot(sales$Index, sales$Sales, 
     xlab = "Index", ylab = "Sales", 
     main = "Sales vs Index with Fitted Models")

abline(M1, col = "red", lwd = 3)

abline(sales$Index, predict(M2), col = "black", lwd = 3)

abline(sales$Index, predict(M3), col = "green", lwd = 3)

legend("topright", legend = c("Linear Model (M1)", "Quadratic Model (M2)", "Cubic Model (M3)"), 
       col = c("red", "black", "green"), lty = 1, lwd = 3)
```

**Comments**

M1 and M2 fit well on the model and the predictive lines are relatovly accurate. you see an issue with m3 where its accurate at first but once sales starts to rise the model becomes ineffective. 

E) Assess the significance of the linear, quadratic and cubic terms in M3 using a Sequential
Sum of Squares (Hint: A sequential ANOVA is necessary.) Comment on the results.

```{r sales}
anova(M3)  
print(anova(M3))
```


**Comments**

The Anova table shows that the linear, quadratic and cubic in the regression model is highly significant. the large F value and low p value contribute to the variations in sales in the model.


F) Choose the best model among M1, M2, and M3 and validate it. Provide reasoning and
comment on the model fit.

```{r sales}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(M2)
```

**Comments**
we can see from the Q-Q plot the model with the best fit is m2, due to this reason weve selcted m2 as the graph used. 

**Question 2**


```{r Campain}
summary(campaign)
```

A) Construct two different preliminary graphs that investigate different features of the data
and comment.
```{r Campain}

par(mfrow = c(1, 3))  

hist(campaign$Score[campaign$Region == "Urban"], 
     main = "Engagement Scores in Urban Regions", 
     xlab = "Engagement Score", ylab = "Frequency", col = "pink")
hist(campaign$Score[campaign$Region == "Rural"], 
     main = "Engagement Scores in Rural Regions", 
     xlab = "Engagement Score", ylab = "Frequency", col = "grey")

boxplot(Score ~ Type, data = campaign, 
        xlab = "Campaign Type", ylab = "Engagement Score", 
        main = "Engagement Scores by Campaign Type", col = "white")
```
**Comments**

Engagement Scores in Urban Regions shows a bi modal graph with 15 and 27 being the most frequent engagement scores

Engagement Scores in Rural Regions shows 2 prominent peaks with 10-15 and 20-25 being the most frequent engagement scores, these are similar to the engagement in urban areas.

the boxplot shows that socail media has the highest level of engagement followed by email then billboards. the boxes have similar ranges with very different medians

B) Write down the full interaction model for this situation, defining all appropriate parameters.

Yijk = μ + αi + βj + γij + ϵijk,

• Yijk: the Engagement Score response;
• αi: the region effect, there are two levels - Urban and Rural
• βj : the Campaign type effect, there are three levels - Billboard, Email and Social Media;
• γij : interaction effect between region and campaign type.
• ϵijk ∼ N(0, σ2) is the unexplained variation.

C) Analyse the data to study the effect of Type and Region on the percentage increase in
engagement Score at 5% significance level. Remember to
• state the null and alternative hypothesis for each test,
• check assumptions (model diagnostics),
• interpret the results.


```{r Campain}


```

**Comments**


D) Repeat the above test analysis for the main effects.
```{r Campain}

```


**Comments**


E) Using TukeyHSD produce multiple comparisons between each level for both Type and
Region. Comment on the effectiveness of the marketing campaign type on customer engagement
scores and also the impact of region on customer engagement scores. (Hint: Confirm the design is
balanced before proceeding with the TukeyHSD test.)
```{r Campain}
